# Wasatch Aquatic Specialties — website (wasatch-acquatics-site)

This repo IS the website for Wasatch Aquatic Specialties. There is no dashboard and no CMS: you
change the site by editing these files and pushing. Live at https://wasatch-acquatics-site.pages.dev/.

How to talk to the client, how texted photos arrive (`incoming/`, one level
up), and what counts as Taylor's work are all in the workspace `CLAUDE.md`
one level above this repo. This file covers only this site: what is in it,
how to change it, and how to check a change is live.

## What this site is

- Plain HTML/CSS/JS static files. **No frameworks, no build step, no npm, no
  external JS libraries.** If a change seems to need one, find the plain
  way or say it's out of scope.
- Two pages: `index.html` (home: hero, about, details) and `photos.html`
  (gallery). `404.html` is what the host shows for a missing page.
- One stylesheet, `css/style.css`. Colors and fonts are the tokens in `:root`
  at the top; change the look there, not scattered through the file.
- One script, `js/main.js` (fade-in on scroll). Motion is transform/opacity
  only, off under `prefers-reduced-motion`, and nothing is hidden with JS off.
- The header, nav, and footer are repeated in every `.html` file (no build
  step means no shared includes). When you edit them, make the same edit in
  **every page**.
- `images/` holds the photos. `_headers` and `_redirects` are read by the
  host, not served: `_headers` makes every page `no-cache` (so nobody ever
  sees a stale page); `_redirects` is for a page that moved. Leave both
  alone otherwise. With a custom domain every page carries a canonical
  link to the bare domain (www serves the same site).
- **No trackers, no analytics, no cookie banners, no checkout.** The only
  forms allowed are the ones that post to patchlamp.com (`newsletter form`
  prints the sign-up box; contact/booking forms follow the workspace
  `PLAYBOOK.md`) — nothing on this site ever stores visitor information
  itself.
- Placeholder content is marked with `REPLACE-ME` comments. Placeholders
  must look like placeholders; never invent facts, prices, hours, or quotes.

## How to change things

- **Copy** (about text, tagline, details, hours, contact): edit the text in
  `index.html`. Ask for anything you don't have; don't guess an address or
  a phone number.
- **A new photo**: save it as a JPG in `images/` with a plain name
  (`images/storefront.jpg`), about 1200px on the long side. Texted photos are
  already converted and resized; move them from `incoming/` (one level up)
  into `images/`. In `photos.html`, copy one whole `<li>…</li>` block (there
  is a commented example), set `src` and `alt`, and remove the "Photos coming
  soon" line once the gallery has a photo. `alt` is a short plain description
  of what's in the photo; never leave it empty. To change the home-page
  photo, replace the placeholder `<svg>` in `figure.about-photo` with
  `<img src="images/…" alt="…">`.
- **A new page**: copy `photos.html`, change the title and content, and add
  it to the nav in **every** page.
- **Colors / fonts**: the `:root` tokens in `css/style.css`.
- **A link** (Instagram, a booking site, a menu on another service): add it
  to the footer list in every page, or as a `.button` in the section it
  belongs to. Linking out is always fine; embedding third-party code is not,
  except a plain `<iframe>` embed from a service the client already uses
  (a map, a player).

## Every change goes live — deploy check

"Done" means live at https://wasatch-acquatics-site.pages.dev/, not edited on disk. Relay sessions run from the
client workspace one level up, so git takes the form
`git -C repos/wasatch-acquatics-site …`; never `cd` into the repo first (that is always
blocked). After any requested change, without waiting to be asked:

1. Look at your work: `shot repos/wasatch-acquatics-site/<page>.html` (add `--mobile` for
   the phone layout) renders the page from disk and saves a picture under
   `shots/`; open it with Read. For anything to do with layout or style, also
   run `shot check repos/wasatch-acquatics-site/<page>.html`. Fix what's off before you
   push. If you touched HTML, also confirm the tags you edited are balanced.
2. Commit on `main` with a short plain-English message
   (`git -C repos/wasatch-acquatics-site add -A && git -C repos/wasatch-acquatics-site commit -m "…"`).
3. Push: `git -C repos/wasatch-acquatics-site push`. The repo is the record.
4. Publish: `site publish wasatch-acquatics-site`. It sends exactly what is committed to
   the host and prints the live URL once it is serving (seconds, not
   minutes). It refuses if anything is uncommitted or unpushed — that is
   the point, not a bug: fix the git step and run it again.
5. Confirm the live site serves the change, with exactly this shape (no
   pipe, no redirect):

       curl -s https://wasatch-acquatics-site.pages.dev/PAGE.html

   (for the home page, `curl -s https://wasatch-acquatics-site.pages.dev/`). Read the output and look for the
   new content yourself. Only say it's live once you have seen it there.
   There is no cache to wait out: every page is served `no-cache`, so a
   phone that reloads sees the new page.

Undo the last change with `git -C repos/wasatch-acquatics-site revert HEAD`, push, and
publish again. Never force-push, never rewrite history. This is standing
permission from Taylor: don't ask "should I push?" for anything the client
asked for. Do stop if a change would break a rule in this file or delete
something the request didn't clearly ask to delete.

## Hosting (for Taylor)

Cloudflare Pages, one project per site, published by `site publish` from
the committed tree of this repo's `main` (direct upload; no build, no
Cloudflare-side git connection). The repo is on GitHub under `patchlamp`
and stays the record; the host is a mirror of it. A custom domain is
`SITE_ADMIN=1 site domain wasatch-acquatics-site example.com` from the workspace (adds
the domain to the project, puts canonical links on every page, prints the
two DNS lines for the registrar). Handing the repo to the
client at the end is `site transfer wasatch-acquatics-site <their-github-user>`.
